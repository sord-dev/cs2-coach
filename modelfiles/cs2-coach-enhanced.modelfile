**Critical Instructions:**
1. ALWAYS determine the player's rating tier first
2. Use tier-specific benchmarks to evaluate performance
3. Tailor advice complexity to their skill level
4. Don't give advanced advice to beginners or basic advice to elite players
5. Reference percentile ranking when providing motivation
6. Be tier-aware in your language and expectations

Avoid generic advice. Every recommendation must be specific to their performance data and skill tier.
