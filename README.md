## üîß Prerequisites

### **Essential Requirements**
1. **Node.js** (>= 18.0.0)
2. **TypeScript** for development

### **Optional AI Requirements**
3. **Ollama** (optional - for AI commentary, not required for core statistical analysis)

> **Note**: The system now works perfectly without AI/Ollama! Statistical analysis provides the core value.

### Installing Ollama (Optional)

Only needed if you want AI commentary on top of the statistical analysis:
- Visit [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and follow the installation instructions
- Set `DISABLE_AI=true` environment variable to skip AI entirely

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Deployed HTTP API (Fastest)

The CS2 Coach is already deployed and ready to use:

**Base URL**: `https://cs2-coach.cs2-stats.workers.dev/`

**Available Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/coaching-advice` - Get personalized coaching advice  
- `POST /api/enhanced-analysis` - Deep statistical analysis
- `POST /api/player-performance` - Performance tracking over time
- `POST /api/rank-analysis` - Compare to target ranks

**Example Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://cs2-coach.cs2-stats.workers.dev/api/coaching-advice" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"playerId": "76561198850657011", "skillLevel": "intermediate"}'
```

### Option 2: Local MCP Server Setup

For Claude Desktop integration:

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd cs2-coach-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```env

CACHE_TTL_AI_RESPONSES_MS=3600000  # 1 hour
```

### 3. Create the CS2 Coach Model (Optional)

Only needed if you want AI commentary (DISABLE_AI=false):

```bash
ollama create cs2-coach -f ./modelfiles/cs2-coach-basic.modelfile
```

### 4. Health Checks

Verify the system is working:

```bash
# Test MCP compliance (always works)
npm run test:mcp-compliance

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Ollama Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Start Ollama if not running
ollama serve
```

**2. CS2 Coach Model Not Found**
```bash
# Create the model
ollama create cs2-coach -f ./modelfiles/cs2-coach-basic.modelfile

# Verify model creation
ollama list | grep cs2-coach
```

**3. Leetify API Rate Limiting**
- The client automatically handles rate limiting with 1 request/second
- Check network connectivity if persistent failures occur

**4. Slow AI Responses**
- Use `skipAI: true` for fast data analysis (1-2 seconds vs 30+ seconds)
- Ensure sufficient RAM for Ollama (8GB+ recommended)
- Consider using a smaller base model if needed
- Check CPU/GPU utilization

**5. "Invalid time value" Errors**
- Updated in v1.1.0: Enhanced date validation handles malformed match data
- Real Leetify API compatibility improvements
- Automatic fallback for missing or invalid date fields

**6. Incorrect Statistics (Zero K/D, ADR, Rating)**
- Fixed in v1.2.0: Complete data processing overhaul for real Leetify API
- Proper field mapping (`total_kills` ‚Üí `kills`, `dpr` ‚Üí `adr`, `leetify_rating` ‚Üí `rating`)
- KAST calculation implementation using rounds data
- Accurate headshot percentage and team statistics

### Core Components & Modular Architecture (Post-Enhancement)

1. **Handlers/Controllers** (`src/handlers/`): Each MCP tool has a dedicated handler class responsible for input validation, orchestration, and delegating to services. This enables isolated development and testing of each tool.
2. **Services** (`src/services/`): Pure business logic for API, AI, and data transformation. No orchestration or cross-tool logic remains here.
3. **Utilities** (`src/utils/`): All reusable helpers (sleep, cache, math, etc.) are in a dedicated utils module, used by both services and handlers.
4. **Types/Schemas** (`src/types/`): All zod schemas and type definitions are centralized for consistency and maintainability.
5. **MCP Server** (`src/server.ts`): Main server implementing MCP protocol, now only wires up handlers and delegates logic.


### Data Flow

1. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas in `src/types/` validate all tool inputs
2. **Request Handling**: Handlers in `src/handlers/` orchestrate each MCP tool, validate input, and delegate to services
3. **Data Fetching**: Leetify API client fetches player statistics (service)
4. **Data Processing**: Data transformer service processes raw stats into coaching insights
5. **AI Analysis**: Ollama service generates personalized coaching advice
6. **Response Formatting**: Handlers return structured coaching recommendations
## üèóÔ∏è Extending & Contributing to the Modular Architecture

### Adding a New MCP Tool (Post-Refactor)
1. **Define input schema** with Zod in `src/types/`.
2. **Create a handler** in `src/handlers/` for orchestration, validation, and response formatting.
3. **Add/extend business logic** in a service in `src/services/` if needed.
4. **Add/extend tests** in `tests/` for the handler, service, and utils as appropriate.
5. **Document** the new tool in this README and update `PLANNING.md`/`TASK.md` if conventions change.

### Project Structure Example
```
src/
  server.ts
  handlers/
    coachingHandler.ts
    areaAnalysisHandler.ts
    improvementHandler.ts
    rankComparisonHandler.ts
  services/
    leetify-client.ts
    ollama-service.ts
    data-transformer.ts
  types/
    index.ts
  utils/
    helpers.ts
```

### Why This Structure?
- **Separation of concerns**: Handlers orchestrate, services implement business logic, utils are shared helpers.
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation.
- **Scalability**: New tools/features can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and file size limits (<500 lines) make the codebase easy to navigate and refactor.

### Real Leetify API Integration

**Raw API Structure Handling:**
- **Match Data**: Processes `RawLeetifyMatch` with real field names (`id`, `finished_at`, `map_name`, `data_source`)
- **Player Stats**: Extracts from `stats` array using `steam64_id` lookup
- **Team Scores**: Handles `team_scores` array with `team_number` mapping

**Field Mappings:**
```typescript
// Raw API ‚Üí Internal Format
total_kills ‚Üí kills
total_deaths ‚Üí deaths  
total_assists ‚Üí assists
dpr ‚Üí adr (damage per round)
leetify_rating ‚Üí rating
total_hs_kills ‚Üí headshots
finished_at ‚Üí date
map_name ‚Üí map
data_source ‚Üí gameMode
```

**Calculated Metrics:**
- **KAST**: Calculated from kills, assists, and survival data
- **Headshot %**: `total_hs_kills / total_kills * 100`
- **Side**: Determined from `initial_team_number` (2=T, 3=CT)
- **K/D Ratio**: Computed from actual kill/death counts
